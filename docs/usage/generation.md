# Generating Luau Code

## Via the CLI

After [installing zap](../install.md), you can run the CLI with `zap [path to config file]`.

The CLI assumes an output folder of `network` unless the `-o`/`--output` flag is specified with a path to another folder.

## Via the playground

Head to the [playground](../playground.md), input your zap config file and paste the outputs into your IDE.
